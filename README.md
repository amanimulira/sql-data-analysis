# Data Analytics on Test Dataset


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is the foundational stage where you inspect and understand raw data before diving into deeper modeling or insights. It's crucial for identifying patterns, anomalies, and relationships early, which prevents downstream errors and ensures data quality.

  - Database Exploration

This involves querying and understanding the structure of the data source (e.g., tables, schemas, relationships in SQL databases). It's important becasue it ensures you grasp the data's origin and integrity, avoiding assumptions that could lead to falwed analyses.
